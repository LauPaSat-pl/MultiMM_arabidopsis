This folder contains three configuration files for three possible types of usage of MultiMM model.

Therefore we have:

- `config_region.ini`: This is a configuration file, about the forcefield in case that the user does not want to model the whole genome, but only a specific region of the genome. We assume that there are no data for compartmentalization, but somebody can add.
- `config_gw.ini`: This is a configuration file in case that the user wants to model the whole genome.
- `config_sc.ini`: This is a configuration file for single cell interactions modelling. We assume that there are no data for compartmentalization. However, somebody can add.
